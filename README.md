## Key
Models:

msk = Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center model

cox = Cox proportional hazards model

las = LASSO Cox model

boo = Boosted Cox model

rsf = Random Survival Forest model


Variables:

co = clinical variables only

comb = Both clinical and mRNA variables

cor = Correlation prefiltered mRNA variables

uni = Univariate Cox feature selection of mRNA variables
